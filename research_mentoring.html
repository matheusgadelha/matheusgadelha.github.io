                **Open Research Mentoring Program**

My goal with this program is to help develop research talent.
I used to hold a research career mentoring session where students usually would come to 
me with questions about applications to grad school or full-time research positions.
I grew a bit frustrated about it because I couldn't really help those students -- 
a quick 30 minute chat is not going to make a lot of difference in anyone's career.
Besides, there wasn't much I could say beyond the usual information that has been repeated
multiple times online.

After some thought, I decided to do something about this.
The idea is simple: if you are interested in being a researcher in computer graphics/vision,
research experience is paramount (even for grad school applications!).
I personally don't like this scenario where students have to be researchers in order to become
researchers (???) -- it makes no sense and ends up perpetuating biases and privilleges that
are already common in our field.
That said, while this is not fixed, people that don't have access to proper research mentorship
have little chance on the market.

# Research Collaboration

If you are interested in doing research in my field, but you are a bit confused on where to start
or what to do, I am here to help.
The idea is simple: we will work together in a problem that you are interested in (as long it is within my area of expertise).
The goal is to do research and, ideally, have some research output in form of a technical report
and/or submission to a good venue.
Hopefully, this experience will allow you to get a kickstart in research and be better positioned
to embark in future research journeys.

# How to Join

Pretty much anyone that is interested in doing research in computer graphics/vision/ML should
be able to join.
If you are a more senior professional with proven track record in other areas and is interested
in exploring new areas, just send me an e-mail.
If you are a junior one, I unfortunately will have to ask you for a homework before we can chat.

## Homework for Junior Mentees

The homework is simple: you should implement a [visual hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_hull) 
algorithm that reconstructs a 3D object
from multiple silhouettes (binary images) of said object.
Figuring out how to get those silhouettes is part of the problem, but don't worry too much:
just rendering a mesh from multiple views using [blender](https://www.blender.org/) should be good enough.
The solution needs to be differentiable (optimized through gradient descent) and support
pinhole camera models (perspective projection).
Create a repo with this code on github and send me an e-mail with a link to it.
I will then schedule a call so we can discuss your solution.
The goal is not to have something perfect and complete, but something to get you acquainted to the area and
the types of problems we will explore.

The main reason I am asking this starter package is to make sure that the mentorship is about
research and not about me teaching you computer vision/graphics/ML concepts.
Of course, I hope you will learn some stuff from me (and myself from you!), but that is not the
main goal.
Also, notice that I made the "homework" purposefully vague: this is the type of challenge you will face
doing research (initially ill-defined problems) so take that as a sample of the job you will do.
If you don't have any research experience, but you are capable of doing the task above, I am confident
we can find a problem that you can tackle where you will do novel and interesting research.

# How it Works

After the initial contact, we will schedule a call so we can get to know each other
and brainstorm about a research problem we are both interested in.
I have many ideas for problems that I would like to work on, but ideally we will find something
that is interesting for everyone involved -- that's the best way to keep all of us motivated.
Then, we will decide what is a good first experiment to work on and that's where the fun starts.
We will not have recurrent meetings scheduled beforehand -- most of our communication will be done
asynchronously (through slack), but we can meet whenever the need arises.
As a rule of thumb, more results = more meetings and more time invested in the project from me (by results I mean experiments,
successful or not, not necessarily
final implementations that solve the problem).

# "Matheus, what will I get out of this?""

Well, first of all, you should have a lot of fun.
I do research because I love it and I like to collaborate with people that feel the same.
Second, my goal is to make you acquainted with research in my area and hopefully help
you develop the skills necessary to become a better researcher.
Third, you may get more tangible benefits like a good recommendation letter and
a nice paper published in a good venue.

# A Note on Internships

The goal of this program is *not* to recruit interns and for a very simple reason:
most of the interns that join our group at Adobe are already published researchers in prestigious
venues -- they are in a much more advanced stage in their career as computer vision/graphics/ML
researchers than the audience this program is targeting.

Example of people this program might benefit.

* Undergrads interested in becoming vision/graphics/ML researchers
* Master's students looking for research experience/publications to help them in Ph.D./job applications
* Experienced professionals interested in switching areas or getting some research experience
* Researchers looking to collaborate in 3D Vision/Graphics/ML
