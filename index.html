I am a PhD student at the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) in the
[University of Massachusetts - Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/).
Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant in the 
[Computer Graphics Research Group](http://graphics.cs.umass.edu/) under the supervision of 
[Prof. Rui Wang](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~ruiwang/).

Prior to joining UMass, I've obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science 
from [Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte](https://sistemas.ufrn.br/portal/PT/), 
while working at IMAGINA Research Lab, under the supervision of Profs. Selan dos Santos 
and Bruno Motta de Carvalho.

I am interested in Computer Graphics, Vision and its intersections with Machine Learning.
More recently, I've been working on image and shape synthesis through deep learning
with [Prof. Subhransu Maji](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~smaji/) and 
[Prof. Rui Wang](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~ruiwang/).

3D Shape Induction from 2D Views of Multiple Objects
----------------------------------------------------
![Learning to create shapes from images without any annotation](prgan/fig/overview.png width="25%")
Our approach called "Projective Generative Adversarial Networks" (PrGANs) trains a deep generative 
model of 3D shapes whose projections match the distributions of the input 2D views. 
The addition of a projection module allows us to infer the underlying 3D shape distribution without 
using any 3D, viewpoint information, or annotation during the learning phase. 
We show that our approach produces 3D shapes of comparable quality to GANs trained on 3D data 
for a number of shape categories including chairs, airplanes, and cars. 
Experiments also show that the disentangled representation of 2D shapes into geometry and viewpoint 
leads to a good generative model of 2D shapes. 
The key advantage is that our model allows us to predict 3D, viewpoint, and generate novel views 
from an input image in a completely unsupervised manner.

Discrete Image Descriptors
--------------------------
Computing descriptors for image features is a crucial task in many applications. 
A good feature descriptor is capable of providing invariance to geometric and lightning transformations 
while consuming as few memory as possible. 
Binary descriptors only store a single bit per pixel comparison, and an useful portion of information, 
about how large the difference of intensity is, is lost due to this quantization. 
This work proposes a generalization of the binary descriptor idea: the discrete descriptor called DRINK. 
Using this idea, we are able to use more information related to the intensity difference while 
preserving the speed of the original binary descriptor.

Generic A* implementation and CSP solver
-----------------------------------------------------
Template-based implementation for the A* algorithm and CSP solver written in C++. 
It is a generic solver, where you can simply define the successor and heuristic function for each problem. 
Includes examples on solving knight shortest path problem and the classic TSP (w/ Minimum Spanning Tree heuristic).
CSP solver includes an efficient sudoku solver example.
