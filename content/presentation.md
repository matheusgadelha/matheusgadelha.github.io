I am currently a Research Scientist at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/).
I received my PhD from [University of Massachusetts - Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/)
while being supervised by [Prof. Rui Wang](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~ruiwang/) and 
[Prof. Subhransu Maji](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~smaji/).
I am interested in Computer Graphics, Vision and their intersections with Machine Learning.
My work is focused on models and representations of tridimensional data for
both discriminative and generative models.

Lately, I have been particularly interested in mechanisms to incorporate 3D capabilities into
large generative models so we can properly control them and robustly create/understand
3D data. I am also broadly interested in techniques (not necessarily ML-based) that allow us
to better manipulate and author 3D content.

**Internships for PhD students:** If you are interested in related areas to the ones I've mentioned above (or anything
related to my previous research), don't be shy and send me an e-mail with your CV and a short
description of the problems you are interested in working on. We are always looking for talented
interns to join us at Adobe Research.

**Pro-bono Mentoring:** If you are a student/early-career researcher/enthusiast seeking advice on research projects
or general career directions, you can use [this link](https://outlook.office.com/book/Mentoring2@adobe.onmicrosoft.com/) to schedule a chat with me.
I am particularly interested in chatting with folks from South/Latin America and helping in any way I can.

**Academic Collaborations:** If you are a professor or a student interested in working with me,
feel free to send me an e-mail -- I am more than happy to discuss interesting research problems we
could work on together (or even just to chat about research).
